                </div>

            <p>Life’s moving fast and with all that we have, we are trying to keep up, trying to find meaning of every moment, making sure that no moment passes by without touching us. We encounter hundreds of people, thousands of thoughts, millions of things (no time parameters) and if we stop and think for a moment, life is so full of everything. The ‘everything’ that we are talking about here is so impactful that it totally defines who we are. We are defined by the people we live with, the thoughts we have and the things we possess. With all these things defining us everytime and everywhere, we somehow and somewhere lose our true definition, even for ourselves. We become what we think we are expected to become instead of being who we are, we no longer work according to our will but according to our new false definitions.<strong> And then we wonder and ask ourselves why the life is not the way I want it to be.strong </strong></p>

            <p>In our childhood days, we chant “honesty is the best policy” and even if not always, often we try to live by it but we forget to be honest for (not ‘to’) ourselves.  We have always heard people saying that be honest to yourself and the truth is we always are and it doesn’t help. We know that everything sucks but we don’t do anything about it because we think doing something about it would effect what we are meant to be. That knowing is being honest to ourselves and doing nothing about it is being not honest for ourselves. <strong> Enough of being honest to yourself, now its time to be honest for yourself.</strong></p>

            <p>It feels so obvious to think that life depends on the choices we make but no matter how fancy and smart it sounds, its a fallacy. Life actually depends on the rejections we make. Choice is something that is not in our hands but rejection is.  If your life is a mess right now, you didn’t choose it to be that way but you can reject to live that way by rejecting the things that make it a mess. We all have something that we didn’t want to have but we can reject it and even if we can we don’t do it, because its hard to reject. Like that one person whom you don’t like but greet him with smile everytime you meet him and pretend to be his friend. This was one small example but think for yourself, how many times in a day you do something that you don’t want to do? <i> And then ask yourself why is your life not the way you want it to be.</i>  </p>
            <p>The value and meaning of your life is not in big moments or big decisions that you will make someday, its today, its now, its in the way you are living right now, its in the fact that are you truly happy or are you pretending to be happy. If you are pretending to be happy its time to be honest for yourself and reject everything that is making you to pretend. Your pretending affects no one but you. Your pretending is the answer to your question above. Reject to pretend, reject to be something that you are not, reject the people that you don’t want in your life, reject the things that you don’t need. <strong>Make your life the living room not the store room. </strong> </p>
            <p>Rejection, of course, is a bit uneasy. How can you just reject everything that you don’t want, its feels so selfish, rude and bad-man stuff. But again reject that feeling, step out of your comfort zone, and ask yourself, “Is rejecting to live a messy life and making life worth living, really rude and selfish?”</p>
            <p>A warning: Rejecting is not going to feel like the rain of roses, but if you cannot take in a few hits to make your life worthy, what are you living for?
                <br> Start making your rejection list…
