            <p>What's the question that has infinite number of answers?</p>
            <p>Don't know? No problem, I got you.</p>
            <p>Don’t know? No problem, I got you.
                There’s a question that we all have in our mind, and probably we know the answer too, but that question has so many possible answers that we cannot decide which one to believe on. The interesting part is that almost all the answers are correct based on the perception with which we see it. Okay, so let’s move the curtains aside and see what the question actually is.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What is life?</strong></p>
            <p>Can you answer that? Yes, of course you can, everyone can. Even a child who plays in the garden and eat chocolates can answer that. But do you think your answer and the answer of that child would be the same? Do you think the answer of a rich man and a beggar would be the same? Do you think the answer of a man living with all luxuries and a saint meditating in mountains would be same? Do you think the answers of Shakira and Bill Gates would be same?</p>
            <p>That’s right. Their answers won’t be same. Their answers would contradict. <br>
                For a child, life = chocolates + games. <br>
                For you (teenagers), life = struggle + dreams + ……..  (if you know what I mean) <br>
                For a businessman, life = pressure + money. <br>
                For a beggar, life = poverty. <br>
                For a saint, life= meditation + enlightenment. <br>
                All of them are right, but yet <strong>partially right.</strong>  Let me tell you a story. <br>

            </p>
            <p> When God was creating earth, he thought of creating an impeccable world, with big palaces full of all luxuries for his people to live in, all technologies already existing from the beginning of the world so that his creatures could come to earth and live a happy life, consider it like a high-end laptop with all software preinstalled. But then he gave it a second thought and decided to make a raw earth consisting of everything that his creature would need to survive and evolve. He wanted his creatures to use earth and it’s resources as they wanted.</p>

            <p>Similar is th e case with our lives. How? Let's find out. </p>
            <p>We cannot give one answer to that the question of life because it has no specific definition, we give a definition to life. <strong> Life is what we make it.</strong> There are millions of answers out there but we have got to decide our answer. The answer that represents us in this world. Life, oftentimes, comes with an answer for everyone (in case a person is very lazy to find any answer) but gives us everything that we need to change that answer. An existing answer does not have to become our answer. We are the creator of our life, the representative of our legacy. Let’s make sure that it’s not a common one.</p>
            <p>If we want your lives to be interesting and full of surprises, we have to have more than one answer. Giving a lot of meanings to your life is what makes it fun to live. So…
                <br><strong> Are you happy with your answer?</strong> If yes, congratulations, if no, go write a new one once and for all.
                </p>
