                We are defined by what we do and our habits make us who we are. Our habits reflect our life, and everything about us.
                Lets look at 5 golden habits that seem to be the manufacturer of a shining life.

            </p>
            <p><strong>1) Living in the moment.</strong></p>
            <p>
                Oftentimes we see our life as one big journey of time which I believe its not. Life is the moment that you are living right now. Life is made of all the ‘now’ that you have lived so far and all those ‘now’ that you will live. So, don’t see your life as something that you have lived or you will live, just see it as what you are living right now. This mentality helps a lot. When you see life as one moment, you are completely aware of it. One can think of wasting time but cannot think of wasting life. So if you see life as a moment you will utilize every bit of it.
               <br><i> Warning: It’s addictive.</i>

            </p>
            <p><strong>2) Playing life with the books.</strong></p>
            <p>The ultimate goal of every human on this planet is to win in life and its rightly said that winners are not born, they are made. When we are born, our minds are empty. As we grow up, we learn from the people and things around us but that learning is very limited as the people we learn from are limited. That’s where the books come in, as from them we learn from the whole of the world. Books help us to win in the game of life. All the knowledge you need is out there, go pick up the right one for you.</p>
            <p><strong>3) Getting obsessed.</strong></p>
            <p>Life is not worth living until you find something or someone to die for. To find the real essence of life, getting obsessed about something is very important. When you are inspired by some purpose, some extraordinary project, all your thoughts break their bonds, your mind transcends limitations, your consciousness expands in every direction and you find yourself in a new great and wonderful world. Dormant forces, faculties become alive and you discover yourself to be a greater person than you ever dreamed yourself to be.</p>
            <p><strong>4) Learning to be self-motivated.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>All of us need a push to move forward. Seeking that push, we often look for motivational videos, quotes, etc. Yes, it works, but for a very short duration of time. Then the push is gone and we again start looking for a new one. If we examine this whole thing carefully, its like having the feelings of patriotism on 26th Jan and 15th Aug, as the day passes so does the feeling. Outer motivation is actually is paradox, it kinda makes you energetic for some time and that energy fades with time. So the self motivation is very important to actually move forward in life. Write down you purpose, your goal, the meaning of your life, visualize it and think about it, that is what provides the self-motivation. Its a practice, the more you do, the better you do.</p>

            <p><strong>Waking up before the sun.</strong></p>
            <p>No matter which part of the world you live in, the most beautiful thing that you can see is the sun rise. The silence of the world and the sound of the nature can be experienced only if you wake up before the sun. If you are missing it, trust me you are missing a lot. Waking up early gives a sense of accomplishment and there can be no better way to start a day than with a sense of accomplishment.</p>
            <p>Have a great <strong>moment.</strong></p>
