                The alarm goes off and with soar eyes you hold the world in your hands. Every morning when you wake up, the first thing that you do is check your phone, get connected to the world via internet. Sending and receiving greetings, you give a go to your day. So normal and usual it seems that we forget to acknowledge the breathtaking technologies that we are using and the ocean of opportunities that these technologies has brought to light for us.
            </p>
            <p>We live in an era in which if something can be thought of, it can be implemented as well. No matter what your academic background is, no matter what CGPA you have, with current technologies, only if you dare to dream you can make it all come true.</p>
            <p><strong>What's stopping you.</strong></p>
            <p>
                You want to be a singer? Upload your music videos to youtube. <br>
                You want to an artist? Post your drawings on Instagram. <br>
                You want to be a coder? Good, start with hackerrank. <br>
                You want to be an entrepreneur? Start solving problems. <br>
                You want to be a cook? Super, cook and upload recipes to a blog or Insta/Youtube. <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Then you would ask me, “Siddharth, those are the options for people who already know how to do it. I’m a beginner, how do I do that?”. “Observe them”, I would say.  All the people who are doing it have started somewhere like you, like a beginner. All you need to do is use the technologies in your favor. That phone that you start your day with, has the potential to start your dream life. No matter what you do and what you want to do, it can teach you everything. We are so fortunate to be born at such a time when a human can be limitless, have all the information needed right away. So, trust me when I say, if you are not living your dream you are just fooling yourself with your excuses. There’s no reason to not live the way you want to.
            </p>
            <p><strong>"But I don't have time"</strong></p>

            <p>
                No one has time. Its true, everyone gets the same 24 hours and everyone is doing something. Even if a person is watching random videos on Instagram and youtube, he doesn’t have time. As a matter of fact, it’s never a matter of time, it’s a matter of priorities. If your sleep is more important than your dream life, then yes, you don’t have time. If chilling out with friends for hours is more important than your dream life, then yes, you don’t have time. If you want it enough, if it becomes your priority, you’ll always have time for it and if its not your priority then there will always be an excuse and something to stop you. Get your over excuses and start to see things clearly. Know what you want, what kind of life you want to live and prioritize things accordingly.
            </p>

                A few tips- <br>
                    <strong>    1)  Be curious: </strong> Whatever you want to do, be curious about it, try to learn about it from wherever you can. When you become curious, you get a lot of questions and in process of answering those questions, you make your way towards your goal. Think about your dreams, solve the problems pertaining to it. Try to find out ways to achieve it. <br>
                    <strong>    2)	Express Yourself:</strong> Show the world what you have. It will help you monetize whatever you are good at. Money is a very basic and important need for everyone and its importance cannot be neglected. So, if you want to earn by doing what you want to do, make sure it reaches to a number of people. Again, your phone can help, social media can help. <br>
                    <strong>    3)	Connect with right people:</strong>	Connect with right people: Often networking is misunderstood as making lot of connections. You don’t need to make lot of connections, you need to make the right connections. Having a lot of connections will distract you but having the right set of connections will always keep you focused and motivated. It will help you in finding your answers. <br>
            </p>
            <p>At whatever place you are, in whatever condition you are, with whatever resources you have, now is the right time to run towards your dream. A good warrior is the one who can mend anything to a weapon. Use all that you have, make use of the technologies, let your eyes sparkle with your dream and go live it.</p>
